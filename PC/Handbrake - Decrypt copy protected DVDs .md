# How to decrypt DVDs using Handbrake
Some DVDs are copy protected so Handbrake can't read/recognize them. Therefore you need to install `libdvdcss` to make it work.


## Download

Go to [this link](https://github.com/allienx/libdvdcss-dll) and download the latest version. 

Put the `libdvdcss.dll` file into the Handbrake folder ex. `C:\Program Files\HandBrake`

Done! 

Handbrake should now be able to scan the titles on your copy protected DVD.
